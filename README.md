# my-first-commit
My very first test program in python from pydroid3...
When prompted just enter any dollar amount, $4.99, $5.99, etc.
You can add as much as you like.(unfortunately theres no subtract function)
When finished adding, you will be asked your state's tax in decimal such as 7% = 0.07 and so on.
After you will receive a final total and a few funny messages have fun 
Will improve in near future...
